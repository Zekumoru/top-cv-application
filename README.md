# CV Project

The first project from the React section of the JavaScript course from The Odin Project. It lets users create their own resume!

This project tests the knowledge learned on the first 3 lessons of React, namely: [React Introduction](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-react-introduction), [State and Props](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-state-and-props), and [Handle Inputs and Render Lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-handle-inputs-and-render-lists).
